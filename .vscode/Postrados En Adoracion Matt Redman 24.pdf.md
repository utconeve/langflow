# Postrados En Adoracion: A Book Review
 
Postrados En Adoracion (Face Down Worship) is a book by Matt Redman, a well-known Christian singer and songwriter. The book explores the biblical concept of worship as a posture of humility and reverence before God. Redman draws from his own personal experiences and insights, as well as from the examples of biblical characters and historical figures, to show how worship can transform our lives and our relationship with God.
 
The book consists of 24 chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of worship, such as intimacy, sacrifice, surrender, gratitude, awe, and joy. Each chapter includes a scripture verse, a reflection, a prayer, and a song suggestion. The book also includes a PDF file with the lyrics and chords of 12 songs by Redman that relate to the theme of the book.

Postrados En Adoracion is a book that challenges and inspires readers to deepen their understanding and practice of worship. It is a book that invites readers to encounter God in a fresh and powerful way, by laying down their pride, their fears, their doubts, and their agendas, and by lifting up their hearts, their voices, their hands, and their lives to God.

One of the main points that Redman emphasizes in the book is that worship is not just something we do on Sundays, but something we do every day, in every situation. He writes, "Worship is a lifestyle; it's not just about our words and songs. It's about how we live our lives in response to God's grace and glory." He encourages readers to worship God not only with their lips, but with their lives, by obeying His commands, serving His purposes, and honoring His name.
 
Another point that Redman makes in the book is that worship is not just about our feelings, but about our faith. He writes, "Worship is not a thermometer that measures our emotions; it's a thermostat that sets our hearts on fire for God." He challenges readers to worship God not only when they feel like it, but when they don't, by trusting His promises, praising His attributes, and remembering His deeds.
 
A third point that Redman highlights in the book is that worship is not just about us, but about Him. He writes, "Worship is not a performance for God; it's a response to God. It's not about what we can do for Him; it's about what He has done for us." He invites readers to worship God not only for what He can give us, but for who He is, by adoring His beauty, magnifying His greatness, and glorifying His name.
