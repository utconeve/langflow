Panzer Corps Gold is not only a collection of scenarios and campaigns, but also a deep and engaging gameplay system that will challenge your strategic and tactical skills. Panzer Corps Gold is a turn-based game, where you and your opponent take turns to move and attack with your units on a hexagonal grid. Each unit has its own characteristics, such as movement range, attack strength, defense value, initiative, spotting range, fuel, ammo and experience. You need to consider all these factors when planning your moves and combat actions.
 
Panzer Corps Gold also features a realistic combat system that simulates the effects of terrain, weather, supply, morale, encirclement, suppression, overruns and more. You can use various types of units in your army, such as infantry, tanks, artillery, anti-tank guns, fighters, bombers, recon and transport vehicles. Each unit type has its own advantages and disadvantages, and you need to use them in combination to achieve the best results. You can also upgrade your units with new equipment and heroes as they gain experience and prestige.
 
Panzer Corps Gold offers a variety of game modes for different tastes and preferences. You can play the grand campaign that spans the entire war from 1939 to 1945, or choose from several smaller campaigns that focus on specific theatres and operations. You can also play single scenarios that range from historical battles to hypothetical what-if situations. And if you want to test your skills against other players, you can join the online multiplayer mode that supports up to 4 players in cooperative or competitive matches.
