One of the main features of the Suzuki method is the use of graded books that contain a series of songs and exercises that gradually introduce new skills and techniques. The first book, Suzuki Violin Method Book 1, covers the basics of violin playing, such as posture, bowing, fingering, and reading music notation. It also includes some famous pieces by composers like Bach, Mozart, and Schubert.
