## What is Stronghold Crusader HD 1.3 Trainer?
 
Stronghold Crusader HD 1.3 trainer is a program that was created by AzKat, a member of MegaGames.com[^1^], a website that offers trainers, mods, patches, and other game-related content. The trainer has 21 cheats that you can activate by pressing certain keys on your keyboard.
 
The trainer works by injecting code into the game's process and changing some values in the memory. This allows you to alter the game's behavior and give yourself an advantage. For example, you can increase your gold, food, wood, stone, iron, pitch, weapons, armor, and goods by pressing F1-F9 keys.
