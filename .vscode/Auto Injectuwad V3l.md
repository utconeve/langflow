- Make sure you have a valid base WAD file and ROM file of the same system.
- Make sure your ROM file is not compressed or interleaved. You can use tools like WinRAR or Lunar IPS to decompress or deinterleave your ROMs.
- If the program freaks out when it goes into the WadTool.exe part, try guiding it to the correct file and pasting the .des files in the right folder.
- If your injected game hangs at a black screen after the classic controller message, try using a different base WAD file or ROM file. Some games may not be compatible with certain base WAD files or may require additional patches or settings.
